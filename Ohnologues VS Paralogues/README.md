# Ohnologues vs BioMart: Paralog Analysis in Human Genes

This project compares paralogue annotations from **BioMart** and **Ohnologue** datasets across multiple similarity thresholds to analyze overlap, density, and paralogue count distributions in human genes.

## ?? Features

- ?? Compares BioMart vs Ohnologue paralogue lists
- ?? Generates density plots of paralogue percent similarity
- ?? Thresholded analysis (30%, 50%, 70%)
- ?? Venn diagrams and scatter plots for paralogue set overlap
- ?? Data cleaning and merging of gene symbol lists
